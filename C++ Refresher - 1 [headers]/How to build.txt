How to build the programs
--------------------------
Note that C++ has changed quite a bit over the past 10 years, after being stagnant for
a while, because committees kept arguing about which additions were highest priority.
The "standard" versions are C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17.  
C++20 is still in development

Just be aware that some code you are going to run into may only build for a specific
version of C++.  For our labs and assignments this semester we will use C++17,
but except for some of the threading stuff, most of the code would work fine in C++14
or even C++11.

On Linux:
	g++ -Wall main.cpp -o prog
	
	
On macOS, unless you installed g++ (using Homebrew or MacPort), the default C++
compiler is the (more advanced) clang++ compiler.  The drawback is that you have to 
specify which dialect of C++ you want to use.  

	-std=c++98  or -std=c++03  or -std=c++11  or -std=c++14  or -std=c++17

and also which standard library to use

	The only one that seems to work is libc++

So...

clang++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -stdlib=libc++ -o prog
